# Roadmap: Advanced Ear Training

## Milestone 1: Theory Foundations & Secondary Dominants
Goal: Establish the theory engine corrections and implement the first advanced level.

### Phase 1: Theory Engine & Spelling
- Goal: Fix enharmonic spelling logic and prepare background theory utils.
- Requirements: THEORY-04, INTEG-01
- Success Criteria:
  - Centralized enharmonic utility returns correct spelling for all keys.
  - New level slots visible in the UI (placeholder state).

### Phase 2: Secondary Dominants
- Goal: Implement full ear training loop for secondary dominants.
- Requirements: THEORY-01, UI-01, UI-04
- Success Criteria:
  - User can hear a progression and identify the secondary dominant.
  - MIDI keyboard input correctly identifies the chord.

## Milestone 2: Modal Interchange & USTs
Goal: Complete the set of advanced functional exercises.

### Phase 3: Modal Interchange
- Goal: Identify chords borrowed from parallel modes.
- Requirements: THEORY-02, UI-02
- Success Criteria:
  - Recognition of iv, bVI, bVII, etc., in a functional context.

### Phase 4: Upper Structure Triads
- Goal: Advanced identification of compound structures.
- Requirements: THEORY-03, UI-03
- Success Criteria:
  - Identification of USTs (e.g., II/I dominant) by ear.
