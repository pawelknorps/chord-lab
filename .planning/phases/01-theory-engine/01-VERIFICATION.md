# Phase Verification: 01-Theory-Engine

## Goal

Establish the theory engine corrections and implement the first advanced level slots.

## Analysis

The core theory engine has been established in `src/utils/theoryEngine.ts`. It provides a centralized way to handle functional spelling, which is the foundation for "correct" advanced ear training. The UI has been updated to include slots for the upcoming levels.

## Checklists

### must_haves

- [x] Centralized enharmonic utility returns correct spelling for all keys.
- [x] New level slots visible in the UI (placeholder state).

### Quality Gates

- [x] Code is type-safe.
- [x] Enharmonic rules follow standard Jazz practice.

## Status: passed

The foundation is ready for implementing specific advanced level logic.
