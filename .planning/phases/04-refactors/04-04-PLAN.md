# Plan: 04-04 Revert ChordLab Layout

The user has explicitly requested to revert the changes to the "Workbench" section (`ChordLab`). The Swiss/Minimalist layout was rejected for this specific module.

## Tasks

<task id="revert-chordlab">
Revert `src/modules/ChordLab/ChordLab.tsx`:
- Remove usage of `ChordLabHUD`.
- Restore the original full-grid layout containing the Header, QuickExerciseJump, and Dashboard.
</task>

<task id="revert-dashboard">
Revert `src/components/ChordLabDashboard.tsx`:
- Bring back `Controls` component.
- Restore the 3-row grid layout (Controls -> Piano -> Workspace).
- Remove the prop-drilling for HUD elements.
</task>

<task id="cleanup">
Delete `src/modules/ChordLab/components/ChordLabHUD.tsx` as it is no longer used.
</task>

## Verification
- Run the app and verify the ChordLab looks exactly as it did before the refactor attempts in Phase 04-02.
