# Plan: 04-01 Refactor Ear Training UI for Minimalist Dashboard

Update the `FunctionalEarTraining` module to align with the new Swiss/Minimalist design system. Focus on reducing visual clutter, using sidebar navigation for levels, and creating a focused "Work Area" for exercises.

## Tasks

<task id="fet-shell-update">
Update `src/modules/FunctionalEarTraining/FunctionalEarTraining.tsx`:
- Remove the top-heavy header and large "hero" sections.
- Move level selection to a cleaner side-menu (using a split layout).
- Use `glass-panel` and `text-swiss-xl` utilities from `index.css`.
- Implement a dedicated HUD component for stats (Score, Streak, Difficulty) that sits quietly at the top.
</task>

<task id="fet-components-update">
Create `src/modules/FunctionalEarTraining/components/HUD.tsx`:
- A minimal component to display Score, Streak, and Difficulty selector.
- Should use `lucide-react` icons (small size) and muted colors.
</task>

## Verification
- Module loads within the global dashboard without double-scrolling.
- Typography matches the global `Inter` font stack.
- Level navigation is persistent on the left (or top if mobile).
- The active exercise takes up the majority of the screen space.
