# Director instrument rotation (Phase 5)

**Policy**: Rotate timbre on every **advance** (every time the user picks "Suggested next" or the Director serves a new item).

**Order**: Piano → Cello → Synth → Piano (see `INSTRUMENT_ROTATION` in `DirectorService.ts`).

**Rationale**: Reduces context-dependency so learning is not tied to a single sound; same material in different timbres improves transfer. Kept simple in Phase 5; can later refine by R/S/D (e.g. lower retrievability → more familiar timbre).
