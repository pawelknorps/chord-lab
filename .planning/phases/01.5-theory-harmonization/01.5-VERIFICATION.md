# Phase Verification: 01.5-Theory-Harmonization

## Goal

Make the unified theory engine the base rule for every section in the website.

## Analysis

By refactoring `src/core/theory/index.ts`, we have effectively updated every module in the application (including ChordLab, NegativeMirror, and EarTraining) to use the new functional jazz rules for note naming. This ensures consistency and correctness throughout the entire platform.

## Checklists

### must_haves

- [x] Functional overrides integrated into core `midiToNoteName`.
- [x] Consistency across modules (no more disparate logic in `theoryEngine` vs `core/theory`).

### Quality Gates

- [x] Backward compatibility maintained for boolean/simple string contexts.
- [x] Jazz functional foundations (Secondary Dominants, Modal Interchange) are now "core" rules.

## Status: passed

The codebase is now harmonized. Ready for Phase 2.
