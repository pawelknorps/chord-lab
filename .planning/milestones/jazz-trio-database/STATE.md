# Jazz Trio Database — State

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Phase 1 (Onboarding and Research)
- **Status**: JTD cloned into `legacy_projects/Jazz-Trio-Database`; milestone PROJECT, REQUIREMENTS, ROADMAP, STATE created. RESEARCH.md to be written.
- **Next**: Optional export pipeline (Phase 2); link from main ROADMAP/STATE if desired.

## Done

- Clone https://github.com/HuwCheston/Jazz-Trio-Database into `legacy_projects/Jazz-Trio-Database`.
- Create milestone `.planning/milestones/jazz-trio-database/` with PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md.
- Write RESEARCH.md: JTD overview, mirdata annotations (Beats, Tempo, Piano Notes), mapping to GrooveManager/soloist-responsive/trio playback, export pipeline idea, JJazzLab complement.

## Blockers / Notes

- JTD audio is on Zenodo; access by request. Annotations (and mirdata) do not require Zenodo for timing/onset work.
- mirdata is Python-only; export pipeline will be Python (or doc-only) for v1.
