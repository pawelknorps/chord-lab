# JJazzLab Playback Research — State

## Status: Research Complete, Ready for Phase 2

- **Phase 1**: Done (research, RESEARCH.md, PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md).
- **Phase 2**: Not started (swing validation + shared pipeline).
- **Phase 3–5**: Not started.

## Blockers

- None.

## Next Actions

1. Run Phase 2: validate `GrooveManager.getSwingRatio(bpm)` against JJazzLab’s SwingTransformations / SwingProfile; ensure useJazzBand uses a single swing + humanization path for bass and drums.
2. Optionally run `/gsd-plan-phase 2` for detailed Phase 2 tasks.

## Notes

- Milestone aligns with `.planning/milestones/jazz-trio-playback` (Creative Jazz Trio Playback) for style matrix and place-in-cycle.
- All borrows are concept/algorithm only; no Java or binary format port.
