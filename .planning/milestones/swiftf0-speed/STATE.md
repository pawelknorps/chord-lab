# SwiftF0 Speed Optimization – State

## Current Status

- **Milestone**: SwiftF0 Pitch Analysis Speed Optimization
- **Status**: Not started
- **Next**: Phase 1 – Measure and baseline (add timing, document baseline, identify cost centers)

## Progress

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Phase 1: Measure and Baseline | Pending | — |
| Phase 2: Inference and Hot Path | Pending | — |
| Phase 3: Scheduling and Polish | Pending | — |

## Requirements

- [ ] REQ-SF0-S01: Measure baseline inference time
- [ ] REQ-SF0-S02: Zero allocations in hot path
- [ ] REQ-SF0-S03: Preprocessing cost reduction
- [ ] REQ-SF0-S04: Align poll interval with inference
- [ ] REQ-SF0-S05: No regression in accuracy/behavior

## Baseline (to be filled in Phase 1)

- **Device/Browser**: —
- **Inference time (ms)**: —
- **Preprocessing time (ms)** (if measured): —
- **Notes**: —
