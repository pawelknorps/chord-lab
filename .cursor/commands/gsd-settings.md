# GSD: Settings

Configure GSD workflow preferences. Read `.planning/config.json` and show current settings (mode, depth, parallelization, commit_docs, milestone_name). Ask what to change or offer options: Mode (YOLO vs Interactive), Depth (Quick / Standard / Comprehensive), Parallelization (Parallel vs Sequential), Commit docs (yes/no). Update `.planning/config.json` and confirm.
