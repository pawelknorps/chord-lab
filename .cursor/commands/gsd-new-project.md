# GSD: New Project

Read and follow **`.agent/workflows/gsd-new-project.md`** step by step. Use `.planning/` for any existing context. Execute the workflow: init check, brownfield check, deep questioning, PROJECT.md, config.json, optional research, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md. Commit with `node rules/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs commit ...` as specified in the workflow. Suggest next step (e.g. `/gsd-plan-phase 1`) at the end.
