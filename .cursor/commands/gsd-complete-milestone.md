# GSD: Complete Milestone

Archive current milestone and prepare for the next. Summarize what was completed (from ROADMAP.md / STATE.md), suggest moving or archiving `.planning/phases/` or milestone docs as needed, update STATE.md and ROADMAP.md for the new version/milestone. Optionally run any gsd-tools command for milestone completion if the project defines one. Recommend next step (e.g. `/gsd-new-project` or `/gsd-plan-phase 1` for the new milestone).
