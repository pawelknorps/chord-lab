# GSD: Add Todo

Capture the user's idea or task as a structured todo. If the project uses `node rules/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs` for todos, run the appropriate command; otherwise create or append to a todo list (e.g. in `.planning/` or STATE.md) with a clear ID, title, and optional context. Confirm what was captured and suggest `/gsd-check-todos` when they want to pick something to work on.
